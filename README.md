# Angular PWA Tool

This is a PWA tool that will turn your Angular 2/4 apps into a PWA. 

## Usage

* Copy all files (except `.travis.yml`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.md`) from this project and place them into your Angular project.
* Run `bash install.bash`.
* Run `ng build --prod`.
* Check Chrome Lighthouse to see if your app is now a PWA.
